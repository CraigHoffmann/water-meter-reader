# Water Meter Reader
##### Remote reading of a South Australian mains water meter
I made this water meter reader specifically for use with my home assistant monitoring system.  (If you haven't heard of [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) I suggest you check it out!)  After already designing a successful electricity meter reader this was my next requirement for home monitoring and automation.
I have read that some water meters have a rotating magnet inside the meter that can be detected by a hall effect sensor but couldn't find any specific information about the meter at my house (a typical South Australian mains water meter) so I decided to sense the rotating needle on the main dial.

The cover had been broken off the meter for years so I decided to make a new 3D printed cover that doubled as the case for the sensor.  If you don't have access to a 3D printer you could probably use the bottom of a plastic container or tin - anything that fits snug over the meter to keep the sensor aligned to the dial.
